GBIF api call parameters

hit the occurrence API with the following specified:
country
hasCoordinate=True
hasGeospatialIssue=False

maybe the following if Brooke actually thinks this would be a useful collaborative project
	isSequenced (likely will steeply impact # of availbale observations)

maybe the following except they might exclude recrds with higher levels of classification
	familyKey 
	genusKey (maybe an option to get this boi)
	speciesKey (probably just this boi)
	
maybe the following if making a mushroom hunting map where time is of the essence
	month
	year (can use math to get some good info about age of observation)


maybe the following if you wanna select within a distance of you/something
	decimalLatitude
	decimalLongitude
	geoDistance

	alternatively, maybe just grab them within a geometry:
		geometry (uses a WKT polygon/multipolygon)

	alternatively, maybe just grab them within a state:
		stateProvince=Washington

Programmatic Parameters
paging the db:
	limit
	offset

make requests on the fly or make requests before? depends on how the data can come across. E.g. if they serve JSON, can do this w pure frontend; if csv/tsv, need an etl process into postgis etc etc puke
